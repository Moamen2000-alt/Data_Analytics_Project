Data Preparation and Preprocessing Steps
1. Handling Missing Values
host_identity_verified: Replace Null values with 'unconfirmed', assuming null value means the host didn't verify themselves.
instant_bookable: Replace Null values with 'False', assuming null value means it hasn't Instant_bookable Option.
cancellation_policy: Remove rows with missing values in this column.
lat and long: Drop rows with null values in both lat and long columns.
neighbourhood group: Drop rows with null values in this column.
2. Imputation
Construction year: Fill the null values in the construction year column with the median construction year.
minimum nights: Fill null values with 1, assuming minimum nights is 1 if not specified.
calculated host listings count:
Calculate the median of calculated host listings count for each host name.
Use the overall median as a fallback for missing values.
Apply a function to fill missing values with the host-specific median or the overall median if the host-specific median is not available.
3. Handling Out-of-Range Values
availability 365:
Check for out-of-range values.
Correct out-of-range values by setting negative values to 0 and values above 365 to 365.
4. Dropping Columns
Drop columns: 'host name', 'license', 'country', 'country code', 'id', 'host id'.
5. Encoding Categorical Variables
room type: Encode room types into numerical values for model compatibility.
cancellation_policy: Encode cancellation policies into numerical values.
6. Creating New Features
price: Ensure all prices are in a consistent currency and format.
service fee: Ensure all service fees are in a consistent currency and format.
number of reviews: Ensure all review counts are integers and properly formatted.
reviews per month: Ensure reviews per month are in a consistent format.

instant_bookable: Ensure instant_bookable values are boolean.
